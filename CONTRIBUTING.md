# Contributing to Sym

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Sym programming language!

This project was created as a comprehensive exploration of language design and serves as a portfolio piece. While it is a fully functional language, it is not actively seeking community contributions for new features at this time.

However, you are more than welcome to:

* **Report Bugs:** If you find a bug or an unexpected crash, please open a detailed issue on the GitHub repository.
* **Suggest Features:** Feel free to open an issue to suggest a new feature or improvement. This can help shape the future direction of the language as documented in the `ROADMAP.md`.
* **Fork the Project:** You are encouraged to fork this repository to experiment with your own ideas for language features!

Thank you for your understanding.
